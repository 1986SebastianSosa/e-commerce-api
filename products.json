      "description": "In the early 2000s a new era of high-gain Orange Amplification tone was ushered in with the Rockerverb series of electric guitar amplifiers. The all-tube Rockerverb 100 MKIII is the culmination of over a decade of fine-tuned adjustments to that game-changing amplifier. The MKIII offers a newly voiced clean channel for a more versatile chimey tone and a dirty channel that will take you anywhere from classic British crunch to the very heaviest in modern metal. Add in power-scaling and footswitchable attenuation and there's nowhere the Rockerverb 100 MKIII can't take you.",

      "description": "TC pushes the envelope yet again for what's possible in a tuner pedal! The TC Electronic PolyTune 3 is faster, more dependable, and more intuitive than ever, boasting accuracy within 0.1 cents and a no-nonsense approach to guitar and instrument tuning — strum all strings* to see which are out of tune at a glance, or tune up one string at a time. Thanks to its built-in BonaFide Buffer circuitry (switchable to true bypass), PolyTune 3 can now even improve your tone for long cable runs. This means you get the treble and transient response that's much closer to plugging directly into an amp. But that's not all that's improved in the TC PolyTune 3. Alternate tuning modes make it fast and easy to explore new ways to craft your art, even in the middle of a frantic set. And an improved auto-dimming LED display makes tuning more comfortable in any environment, indoors or out.",

      "description": "Ernie Ball has been in the music business since the 1960s. It all started with making custom sets of lighter gauge guitar strings so guitarists could make their axes easier to play. After fruitless attempts to interest major guitar manufacturers in a lighter set of strings, Ernie Ball decided to start making his own. As time went by they started making other accessories, including guitar straps. Made from high-quality materials and thoughtful design, Ernie Ball straps are extremely comfortable, functional, and stylish. You can't go wrong when you string up with Ernie Ball straps! The Ernie Ball Polypro strap is a comfortable polypropylene webbing strap with leather ends. A 2\" width makes this a comfortable strap for guitar or bass. It's adjustable from 38\" to 68\" in length. The durable Ernie Ball Polypro Strap is the perfect strap for your instrument.",
