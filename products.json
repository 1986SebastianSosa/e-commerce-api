      "description": "Combine time-tested acoustic design and a natural-sounding pickup system, and you've got the Taylor 214ce Deluxe. Its Grand Auditorium body has the width and depth of a dreadnought, but its tapered waist and graceful contours make it look like a smaller instrument and impart balance and presence to the big sound, making it a favorite of recording engineers at Sweetwater. With its slender and fast neck, the 214ce Deluxe plays like a Taylor, which is to say, effortlessly. With the 214ce Deluxe, you'll feel well-equipped both on stage and in your studio.",
