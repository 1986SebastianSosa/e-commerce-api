      "description": "TC pushes the envelope yet again for what's possible in a tuner pedal! The TC Electronic PolyTune 3 is faster, more dependable, and more intuitive than ever, boasting accuracy within 0.1 cents and a no-nonsense approach to guitar and instrument tuning — strum all strings* to see which are out of tune at a glance, or tune up one string at a time. Thanks to its built-in BonaFide Buffer circuitry (switchable to true bypass), PolyTune 3 can now even improve your tone for long cable runs. This means you get the treble and transient response that's much closer to plugging directly into an amp. But that's not all that's improved in the TC PolyTune 3. Alternate tuning modes make it fast and easy to explore new ways to craft your art, even in the middle of a frantic set. And an improved auto-dimming LED display makes tuning more comfortable in any environment, indoors or out.",

Its feature set extends far beyond the usual suspects (rate, depth). An analog LFO with waveform switch toggles between sine and triangle wave shapes, enabling more reserved or dramatic effects as occasions demand; an LFO LED blinks in time for visual feedback. Most unique to the Walrus Audio Julia V2 is the Lag control, which determines how much “swing” each LFO sweep has. Together with the Depth control, Julia’s Lag knob really takes this pedal into a new realm of sound-shaping possibility. A fully continuous blend control dials between dry, chorus, and vibrato sounds. True bypass switching preserves your tone when Julia is out of the loop.",
